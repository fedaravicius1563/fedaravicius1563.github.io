    <h1>
        My Favorite Teachers!
    </h1>
    <h2>
        This is a list of my top 5 teachers from high school.
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mr. Konecki</li>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mr. Konecki is a very funny teacher. He lets you choose whether or not you do the homework since he believes it was made to help you, and he makes the classroom weird and unique.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>Mr. Peak</li>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mr. Peak has now retired, but he made Advanced Algebra 2 a blast for me. He would always reward the students that performed well (with Peak Professor Pencils<sup>TM</sup>) and made sure that everyone in the class was understanding the content he was teaching.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>Mr. Engels</li>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mr. Engels is a very nice teacher who gives extra credit and allows his students to make the learning enviroment become more fun.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>Mr. Beers</li>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mr. Beers is a very unique teacher. In freshman year, he made my AP Seminar class a lot more fun in the first semester by making team projects, such as making a paper airplane and launcher and make board games. We also had a lot of field trips.
        </p>
        <br>
        <li>Mr. Kroll</li>
        <br>
        <p>
            Mr. Kroll gives the students a lot of hands-on experience in PLTW, and makes the class fun and competitive by introducing challenges that small groups have to solve. We also got to use computer to use Inventor a lot, a very good program for designing objects.
