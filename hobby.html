        Rubik's Cube Solving
    </h3>
    <img src="img/Rubik.jpg">
    <p>
I have been solving Rubik's Cubes since 6th grade. My personal fastest solve on a 3x3 is 14 seconds. I can solve any standard cube that is out there except square 1. I don't solve as much as I used to a couple years ago, which has caused me to become slower, but I am still able to solve at a fast pace.
